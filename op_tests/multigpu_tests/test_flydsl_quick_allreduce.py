"""Runtime correctness and timing for FlyDSL quick all-reduce (``FlyQuickAllReduce``).

A default run covers what production dispatch can run on this host, and each
sweep ends in a markdown table:

* ``test_quick_allreduce_int4`` -- the shipping configuration (codecs and
  super-tile left to the per-world defaults and ladders, as production dispatch
  constructs the engine), timed with ``run_perftest``. The payloads come from
  ``allreduce_policy``: for every schedule it routes to at each world size, the
  smallest payload that reaches each kernel it can select there, plus the top
  of its window. One row per schedule and world size captures the all-reduce
  into a CUDA graph and replays it. A schedule the policy never selects on this
  host (the ring on xGMI) gets one row, for a user who moves the boundary with
  ``AITER_FLY_AR_MESH_MAX_BYTES``.
* ``test_quick_allreduce_int4_coverage`` -- the kernels those rows ran include
  every kernel the engine's own ``cfgs_for`` says the window selects.
* ``test_quick_allreduce_int4`` again, as a second table -- the shipping INT4
  ladder with ``block`` and ``skip_self`` overridden on every rung, at the
  geometry that caught a VMEM store-data hazard.
* ``test_quick_allreduce_int4_edge_inputs`` -- payloads that land on the E4M3
  scale's edge cases, and degenerate groups that must stay finite.
* ``test_quick_allreduce_transport`` -- the ``fp16`` wire format, a lossless
  passthrough, on an exactly representable input: the result must be
  bit-identical to the fp32 reference, which separates a chunk-addressing or
  flag-protocol bug from a codec one. Run through each production schedule's
  ladder on the shipping payloads, so it covers the geometry that ships.

``--extended`` adds what production never selects: the legacy fixed shipping
shapes, the full ``block``/``skip_self`` sweep, the fp16 transport over a
matrix of pinned ``super_tile``/``block``/``skip_self``, and
``test_quick_allreduce_int4_pinned_codec`` -- the ring with its wire formats
pinned per lap: all-INT4 at TP8, and one lap lossless to isolate the other.

Every mesh row also checks that all ranks wrote bit-identical output: each
rank decodes every chunk from the same packets, its own included, and under
``skip_self`` it decodes its own from the packet it sent rather than from its
inbox. The ring's owner stores its chunk before the all-gather quantization, so
its ranks legitimately differ and only report the count.

Every rank is a ``multiprocessing`` spawn worker that builds its own engine.
All rows that share an engine configuration ride one spawn. The oracle is an
untimed fp32 NCCL all-reduce of the same per-rank inputs. INT4/INT6 are lossy,
so those rows gate on SQNR, a calibrated mismatch ratio and a per-tile SQNR
floor.

The kernels see a flat payload, so the derived shapes use one width, 4096,
whose rows land exactly on every policy and ladder boundary.
FlyQuickAllReduce runs on gfx942/gfx950 at TP in {2, 4, 8}; other archs skip,
and ``main()`` skips a world size when fewer GPUs are visible than TP.
