"""Kernel comparison benchmark for aiter's all-reduce implementations.

Every implementation reachable from the plain (unfused) all-reduce path is a
candidate here, so one sweep answers "which of the things aiter can do to an
all-reduce is fastest at this shape, and what does it cost in accuracy".

The three ``fly_*`` families are the ones with a dispatch question open: which
of them wins is a function of payload size, and so is which variant wins inside
each. Every ``fly_*`` key above is joined by pinned tuning rows
(``fly_int4_ring_st16``, ``fly_1stage_b256_a4_g64``, ...) whose only purpose is to be
swept against the auto rows. A key names a *policy*, not a binary -- the auto
rows walk a size ladder -- so the ``variant`` column and the ``kernel variants``
table report the JIT symbol that actually ran at each shape, super-tile and
block count included.

Candidates are skipped (an ``n/a`` cell in the latency/accuracy/busbw/roofline
tables, or no column at all when nothing in the sweep could run them) where
they do not apply:

* ``cdr_fp8`` is **fp16-only and only above 128*2048 elements** -- below that
  ``custom_all_reduce.cu:90`` silently runs the plain kernel instead, so timing
  it there would report the same number twice under two names.
* ``qr_*`` need TP in {2, 4, 8} and fp16/bf16; ``qr_int3`` is additionally
  TP2-only (it is disabled on larger worlds in
  ``quick_all_reduce.py:212-224``).
* ``fly_int4`` needs bf16, TP in {2, 4, 8} and gfx942/gfx950.

The first table printed is the ``summary``: per shape, the fastest candidate
clearing an accuracy floor (``fastest collective``), the fastest bit-accurate
one (``fastest exact collective``), and each one's ratio against the
production path (``prod collective``, ``prod time (us)``). The floor defaults
to ``DEFAULT_MIN_SQNR`` and exists so a codec that is fast only because it
barely transmits anything cannot win the column; ``--min-sqnr`` moves it, and
``fastest collective SQNR dB`` prints what the winning choice actually cost.
The ``latency & accuracy by case`` tables below it are the full picture the
summary collapses: one small table per shape, one row per candidate, latency
(``us``, speedup vs the baseline) and accuracy (``SQNR dB``) side by side --
a candidate below the floor still appears there.

Because the candidates are **not accuracy-equivalent**, every one is graded on
SQNR against a common fp32 reference and asserted against its own floor in
``CANDIDATES``, so a real regression fails regardless of which accuracy class
the candidate is in. The exact kernels land at the bf16 rounding floor (~55 dB;
RCCL a little lower since it reduces in bf16 rather than accumulating in fp32),
the quantized ones at their codec's floor. Speed alone is a misleading read for
everything in the "exact = no" rows above -- each case's table prints ``us``
next to ``SQNR dB`` for exactly that reason.

``busbw`` (``--busbw``) is always computed on the payload dtype, including for
the quantizing candidates whose wire format is several times smaller: the
question the table answers is "how fast does my (M, hidden) all-reduce finish",
not "how efficiently is the wire used".

**``us`` is HIP-graph replay time by default** (``--timing graph``): capture the
collective, replay it, divide. That is the metric a captured deployment sees --
decode is captured -- and it is the only fair kernel-to-kernel comparison here.

``--timing eager`` switches to hipEvent wall time around the Python call. Read
that number knowing what it contains: ``run_perftest`` brackets a loop of
back-to-back calls, so once host cost per call exceeds device time the GPU
starves and the measurement *is* the host cost. That cost also differs per
candidate family (``cdr``/``qr`` go through pybind, the FlyDSL rows through
``_run_compiled``, ``rccl`` through an aten op plus a ``copy_``), so eager
partly ranks candidates by how much Python sits in their bench thunk -- a
property of this harness, not of the kernel. Every boundary in
``allreduce_policy`` is a crossover *between* families, so that bias lands
straight on the shipped thresholds. Either way the peer-wait that dominates the
1-stage kernel is included, and the torch profiler is not usable here -- see
the note in ``_bench_shape``.

Which ``cross_device_reduce_*`` runs is chosen by the C++ host dispatch in
``csrc/include/custom_all_reduce.cuh`` (``CustomAllreduce::allreduce``), keyed on
world size and message bytes. There is no env override, so the only way to reach
a given kernel is to pick a shape:

    use_new=true  (``cdr``)          | use_new=false (``cdr_naive``)
    world == 2            -> 1stage  | world == 2            -> 1stage
    world <= 4, < 160 KiB -> 1stage  | world <= 4, < 512 KiB -> 1stage_naive
    world <= 8, <  80 KiB -> 1stage  | world <= 8, < 256 KiB -> 1stage_naive
    otherwise             -> 2stage  | otherwise             -> 2stage_naive

**TP2 can only reach the 1-stage kernel**; the default shape list straddles both
TP4 boundaries (M=11/12) and the TP8 one (M=5/6). The ``kernel`` / ``naive``
columns report the prediction for each row.

The benchmark calls the kernels directly rather than going through
``tensor_model_parallel_all_reduce``, so each is measured at every size even
where production would not select it. The ``prod path`` column reports what
``CudaCommunicator.all_reduce`` *would* dispatch for that row under the
environment you launched with -- so a row can read ``prod path = rccl`` while
still carrying custom-AR timings. That is the point: it shows what the
production gates leave on the table.

    The headline answer: for this shape, what is the fastest thing aiter can do
    to an all-reduce, and how much faster is it than what production actually
    dispatches here?

    **"Production" is derived per row from ``prod path``, not from a fixed
    candidate.** An earlier version used *every* row's ``prod time (us)`` from
    a single CLI-selected baseline (``cdr`` by default) while labelling the
    column with the per-row ``prod path`` string -- so a row where production
    falls back to RCCL (large messages past the custom-AR cutoff, or QR
    disabled) printed ``prod collective = rccl`` next to ``cdr``'s time and
    efficiency under that name. The two must always describe the same
    collective: ``_prod_candidate_key`` parses ``prod path`` (``"rccl"``,
    ``"cdr:<kernel>"``, ``"qr:<regime>"``) back into the ``CANDIDATES`` key
    that was actually timed, and every ``prod *`` column below comes from that
    key's own row -- never from an unrelated fixed baseline.

    A row can still show ``prod collective`` with no timing: if ``prod path``
    names a candidate the sweep did not measure (``-c`` excluded it, or the
    env implied a candidate the sweep never enabled), ``prod time (us)`` is
    NaN and a rendered ``-``. That is reported once per candidate rather than
    silently substituting a different collective's number -- see the log line
    this emits.

    **Ranked on speed alone this table would be a trap**, which is why the
    winner is accuracy-gated and why there are two of them:

    * ``fastest collective`` is the fastest candidate clearing *min_sqnr*
      (default ``DEFAULT_MIN_SQNR``), with ``fastest collective SQNR dB``
      printed beside it so the cost of the choice is never off-screen. Without
      a floor the winner would be the widest-error codec in the sweep at
      nearly every shape -- ``qr_int3`` at ~12 dB is ~25% relative error and
      beats everything on speed.
    * ``fastest exact collective`` is the fastest of the bit-accurate
      candidates, i.e. the fastest option that does not change the model's
      numerics at all. Membership is decided **per shape**, not per candidate:
      ``fly_auto`` dispatches to the exact one-shot below its policy ceiling
      and to a quantized schedule above it, so it belongs in this column on
      some rows and not others. Omitted when every candidate in the sweep is
      exact at every shape, since it would just repeat ``fastest collective``.

    A candidate excluded by the floor is not hidden: it keeps its row in that
    shape's ``latency & accuracy by case`` table, and the count of rows where
    the floor changed the winner is logged, so the default can never silently
    bury a result.

    Both ratios are ``prod time (us) / fastest time (us)``, so **> 1.0 means
    faster than production**, matching ``case_tables``'s ``vs <baseline>``
    convention. A row whose winner *is* the production path reads 1.0, which
    is the useful answer that nothing beat it.

    *roofline*, when given the ``measured`` lookup from ``measure_roofline``,
    adds a ``prod eff`` / ``fastest eff`` / ``fastest exact eff`` column next
    to each winner -- the same ``roof us / cand us`` ratio as
    ``roofline_table``, graded on that candidate's own wire bytes, so a
    quantizing winner is not held to the exact candidates' ceiling. This is
    also why a faster winner can show a *lower* eff than a slower one: e.g.
    ``fly_int4`` sends 1/4 the bytes of ``rccl``, so its roof is a quarter the
    size, and the same fixed quantize/dequantize and launch overhead is a
    larger fraction of a smaller roof. Faster-but-less-efficient is the
    signature of a candidate that is winning on payload reduction rather than
    on using the fabric well.

    ``roof us`` is the fastest way TransferBench could move this row's *payload*
    bytes, over one-shot, two-shot and ring; ``roof algo`` names the winner.
    Each ``<cand> eff`` uses the same best-over-algorithms roof but at that
    candidate's own wire size (``transferbench_roofline.wire_bytes``), so a
    quantizing candidate is graded on the bytes it really sends rather than the
    ones it was handed.

    ``eff`` is ``roof us / cand us``, so **1.0 means the candidate is at the
    ceiling and values above 1.0 should not occur**. Two ways to read it:

    * **Well below 1.0 at small sizes is expected, not a finding.** The
      roofline has no peer handshake, and the 1-stage kernel is dominated by
      the ``start_sync`` spin there. The gap is the sync cost, not waste.
    * **Above 1.0 is a bug in the roofline**, not a fast kernel. It means some
      algorithm the candidate can reach is not in ``_ALGOS``, so the "ceiling"
      is really the cost of an algorithm the candidate beat. This is exactly
      what a two-shot-only model did to ``rccl`` on a NUMA-split PCIe host
      (``eff`` 1.18, because RCCL rings and the model did not). Add the missing
      pattern rather than explaining the number away.

    ``roof algo`` is worth reading next to the ``kernel`` column: where they
    disagree, the dispatch picked an algorithm this fabric does not favour.

    *measured* is the lookup from ``measure_roofline``.
