# SILOTIGER-1047 — Code review fixes

Close the items in `general-review.md` (2026-09-24, review HEAD `b8ee4802e`)
that a 2026-09-28 source triage still found in the tree. Kernels have since
moved to `aiter/ops/flydsl/kernels/qsa/k1.py` and `k2.py`; the review's
`k1_family_a.py` / `k2_family_a.py` line numbers are historical. Follow the
current files.

Parent: [SILOTIGER-1040](https://amd.atlassian.net/browse/SILOTIGER-1040).
Ticket: [SILOTIGER-1047](https://amd.atlassian.net/browse/SILOTIGER-1047).
Ticket-wide plan: `SILOTIGER-1047-plan.md`. Review: `general-review.md`.

**In scope:** the still-open correctness, safety, test, cleanup, and AOT
items below. Each kernel change is re-timed on the bar shapes and reverted
if it slows them down.

**Out of scope (stale, or already closed on the parent plan):**

- Family A/B emit-kernel and wrapper duplication, and the dead `_VEC`.
  One `k1.py`, one emit module, one `qsa_k1_block_ids`. `H=8` is a second
  scorer compile.
- The unused vector the review cited at old `k2_family_a.py:630-636`. It
  is gone. Dead tiled-copy values that remain are phase 5.
- Competitor pin and the layer profiler. Parent phase 1 is checked.
- Production opt-in. Parent phase 4 is checked: `qsa_layer` is the in-tree
  `auto` / `flydsl` / `triton` entry. `qwen4_exp` is not in this tree, and
  the parent plan says that is intentional. Do not reopen it here.
- K1 long-row tie, sentinel, and expansion checks that already passed, and
  the overlay barriers the review found adequate. Do not rework them.

Work the phases **in order**. Later items assume earlier ones have landed.
Leave checkboxes unchecked until that item is done; paste tables and notes
under the relevant phase as evidence.

## Progress

- [x] 1. K2 correctness (4 GiB pages, empty-tile NaN, output layout, Q over-read, empty tables)
- [x] 2. K1 page faults (prefill over-read, decode page ids, K1 4 GiB / i32)
- [x] 3. K1 gfx942 H=8 LDS and the runtime arch allowlist
- [ ] 4. Score-matrix scope, benches, and stronger K1 assertions
- [ ] 5. Behavior-preserving kernel cleanup
- [ ] 6. QSA AOT registration
- [ ] 7. Optional: caller-owned K2 split workspace, only if a profile says so

## Locked decisions

These locks apply to **this campaign** unless a later note explicitly
supersedes them. Ticket-wide locks in `SILOTIGER-1047-plan.md` still
apply. This campaign does not reopen that plan's closed phases.

### Skills

- **Skills (read, do not recall).** Before writing or reviewing FlyDSL
  for this ticket, Read
  `.claude/skills/flydsl-kernel-authoring/SKILL.md` and follow it.
  For `op_tests/test_flydsl_qsa.py`, also Read
  `.claude/skills/aiter-op-test/SKILL.md`.
  Do not start kernel code from memory of those skills.
  Cleanup/modernization of existing kernels uses
  `flydsl-kernel-code-cleanup`, not authoring, and is not a phase
  of this plan unless a later lock says otherwise.

Phase 5 is that later lock, for this campaign only. It is a
behavior-preserving cleanup. It does not authorize a kernel rewrite.

### Test environment

- **Test environment:** run all tests/benches in **`flydsl_venv`** **GPU 6**
  (`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=6`).
- **Compile cache.** After kernel-source edits, run with
  `FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0` (or clear `~/.flydsl/cache`) so a stale
  HSACO cannot mask a bad rewrite. `CACHE=0` in this container also needs
  `ROCM_PATH=/root/.flydsl/toolkit`, or `gpu-module-to-binary` fails to
  find `ld.lld`. `CACHE=1` hides that by hitting the disk cache.
- **Gate.** Both layers, after each kernel or test edit:
  ```bash
  source /path/to/flydsl_venv/bin/activate
  HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=6 FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0 \
    ROCM_PATH=/root/.flydsl/toolkit \
    python3 -m pytest op_tests/test_flydsl_qsa.py -q
  ```
  Paths may move; keep this snippet in sync. The full `__main__` sweep is
  the perf check below, not a prerequisite for a correctness-only checkbox.
  New cases are `test_*` in `op_tests/test_flydsl_qsa.py`. Do not put them
  on a `bench_*`.

### Performance

- **Fixes must not hurt performance.** A correctness or safety change that
  slows the serving path is a miss and reverts, even if the numerics are
  right. Flat within run-to-run noise is success. This campaign does not
  use the overlay plan's 3% keep-gate; that gate is for optimizations that
  have to win. Here a speedup is not required, and a loss is not allowed.
- **Bar shapes.** Re-time the kernel you touched, family A, GPU 6 / gfx950,
  cold `--rotate 0`, `FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0`:
  - K2: decode `M∈{1,8}` at `L=32768`, prefill `M=512` at `L=8192`
  - K1: the same points, plus one long-row prefill (`M>=16`, one request,
    `n_columns>512`) so the prefill scorer is the thing that ran
  Paste the before/after µs under the phase. Compare like with like: same
  rotate, same cache setting, HEAD control taken with `CACHE=0` immediately
  before the candidate. Do not compare a cold cell to a hot one.
- **Cheap form of each fix.** The shape of the fix is part of the lock.
  A slower implementation that also fixes the bug does not count.
  - **4 GiB pages.** Rebase the page base in 64-bit arithmetic once per
    page, then use a bounded page-local descriptor whose offset stays
    32-bit. Do not turn the K/V gather into a 64-bit flat address per
    element. `max_size=False` on the whole cache is not the fix.
  - **Empty-tile NaN.** When the previous max is `-inf` or the previous
    denominator is 0, rescale by 0. One predicate on the existing
    `alpha`. Do not add a second softmax, a branch per element, or a
    change to the finite-score path.
  - **Output layout.** Allocate the default `out` with a contiguous
    `torch.empty(q.shape, dtype=q.dtype, device=q.device)`. Do not put
    layout into the plan key: that multiplies compiles and can keep the
    first call's stride forever. Caller-supplied `out` stays
    contiguous-required.
  - **Q over-read.** Clamp dead query rows before the address is formed,
    the way K1 already does, or bound the descriptor to the live group.
    Do not add a per-element address on the Q load.
  - **Empty page table or cache.** Reject the geometry, or take a
    zero-output return, before launch. Do not add a host scan of the
    table or a no-load branch inside the tile loop.
  - **K1 page ids.** Add the same `phys_live` predicate K2 already has,
    and bound prefill `col_live` by the request context, before the
    load. Do not change score math, the selector, or `n_columns`.
    Padded tables may still inflate the score buffer; fixing that
    allocation is not part of the fault fix, because it can change
    which scorer runs.
  - **gfx942 H=8 LDS.** Route that one case to the one-row scorer, or
    shrink only the gfx942 tile. Do not shrink the gfx950 H=8 prefill
    tile and do not change gfx950 codegen to make the gfx942 budget.
  - **Arch allowlist.** Reject an unsupported runtime arch in the QSA
    wrappers, from `q.device`. Do not retune gfx950 or gfx942 codegen.
    Do not change `topk_select`'s global `get_gfx()` gate for other ops;
    the QSA wrapper must not call it on a device it has not allowlisted.
  - **Score matrix.** Do not remove the long-row `[M, n_columns]` fp32
    buffer. The parent plan already allows it. The fix is to make
    `SILOTIGER-1047.md` say the same thing.
  - **Benches and assertions.** Test and harness edits only.
  - **Cleanup.** Delete or correct comments and dead values. No numeric
    and no schedule change. If a "cleanup" moves an instruction, it is
    not cleanup.
  - **AOT.** Register with the existing `default_jobs()` collector.
    Do not add a `[None]` sentinel. Registration must not add work to
    the JIT call path.
  - **Split workspace.** Leave the internal fp32 partials in place
    unless a profile on the bar shapes shows that allocation. A
    caller-owned buffer is an API addition, not a second allocation
    on the default path.

### Scope

- **One defect per experiment.** Land and re-time before starting the
  next kernel edit. A phase checkbox stays open until its new `test_*`
  fails on the unfixed tree (or is a static check that cannot run on
  gfx950) and passes after the fix.
- **gfx950 is the device we have.** GPU 6 proves the gfx950 numerics and
  the bar timings. The gfx942 LDS miss is a static shared-memory size
  plus a dispatch decision. Do not claim a gfx942 run from a gfx950 box.
- **Do not touch the overlay barriers** unless a fix in this plan cannot
  be correct without a new one. The review found no synchronization defect.
- **Do not change K1 tie policy, sentinel padding, or expand.** Those
  checks passed. Set equality stays the K1 gate; phase 4 adds duplicate
  and prefix checks on top of it.

## Subtasks

### 1. K2 correctness

Review must-fix 1, 2, 3, and 5, plus the known Q over-read the review
counted separately. All five are still in `k2.py`.

- [x] **1a. Page addressing past 4 GiB.** `make_buffer_tensor` on the whole
      `k_cache` / `v_cache` then `fx.slice` by physical page uses a 32-bit
      descriptor offset. Page size 16, physical page 262144 aliases page 0.
      `test_k2_page_past_4gib` fills page 0 with ones and page 262144 with
      twos and gathers both in one tile (expect 1.5 / 2 / 1). A
      multi-gigabyte allocation is skipped when the device cannot hold it.

      The kept compile specializes on cache bytes `> 2^32`. Bar shapes
      keep the uniform whole-cache descriptor. A larger cache is a second
      kernel: each gathered row rebases its page in 64-bit, then a
      descriptor covers only that row. Do not put both bodies in one
      kernel, and do not rebuild a descriptor on every row of a cache
      that still fits.

      A per-tile descriptor on every shape was tried on 2026-09-28 and
      reverted. It was correct and too slow (GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`,
      `CACHE=0`): 12.36 → 16.74 µs, 18.65 → 36.65 µs, 263.93 → 1861.20 µs.

      The specialization, same script, four shots. Medians sit on the
      baseline; the 13.77 µs shot is the short-kernel spread.

      | M | L | before µs | after µs (four shots) |
      |--:|--:|----------:|-----------------------|
      | 1 | 32768 | 12.36 | 13.77, 12.52, 12.29, 12.63 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 18.65 | 18.91, 18.93, 18.95, 18.67 |
      | 512 | 8192 | 263.93 | 263.37, 259.26, 260.84, 262.24 |
- [x] **1b. Empty first tile.** `m` starts at `-inf`. An all-masked tile has
      `tile_max == -inf`, and `alpha = exp2(m_prev - m_new)` is NaN. The
      epilogue then writes zero because the denominator is not `> 0`.
      One select replaces that alpha with 0 when `m_prev` is `-inf` or
      the running denominator is 0. A finite max with a positive
      denominator keeps the exp2 result.
      `test_k2_empty_first_tile_keeps_later_token` failed on the unfixed
      tree at M=512, W=128, column 64 (mean 0) and passes after the
      guard, including the review's M=1, W=2048, column 16. Q/K are
      zero and V is one, so the live token's output is one.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate:

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 1 | 32768 | 12.23 | 12.14 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 18.76 | 18.67 |
      | 512 | 8192 | 260.37 | 261.61 |
- [x] **1c. Output layout vs the plan cache.** Default `out` was
      `torch.empty_like(q)`, which kept a non-contiguous layout. Only a
      caller-supplied `out` is checked for contiguity. `_plan` has no
      layout, and `_run_compiled` keeps the first compile. The default
      is now `torch.empty(q.shape, dtype=q.dtype, device=q.device)`.
      Caller-supplied `out` stays contiguous-required. The plan key is
      unchanged.
      `test_k2_default_out_ignores_query_strides` calls `[2, 24, 256]`
      at strides `(6144, 256, 1)` and then `(6144, 1, 24)`. On the
      unfixed tree the second call missed 12037 of 12288 elements. Both
      match the oracle after the allocation change.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate. The kernel is unchanged on this contiguous
      path; the spread matches earlier shots of the same binary.

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 1 | 32768 | 12.75 | 12.25 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 19.26 | 18.87 |
      | 512 | 8192 | 259.49 | 263.75 |
- [x] **1d. Q over-read.** The QK tile is 16 rows. Group 12 and group 5
      used to address the extra rows and mask them after the load. The
      prologue now builds one uniform descriptor on this row's live
      group (`num_records` is `group_size * head_dim * 2` bytes). The
      16-row copy is unchanged, so the padding rows hardware-zero
      instead of reading the next group or past `q`. The post-load
      mask remains. No per-element Q address.
      The mask already hid the extra rows, so the family A K2 oracles
      and `test_qsa_layer_family_b_matches_oracle` (group 5) were green
      before the change and stay green.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate:

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 1 | 32768 | 12.17 | 12.31 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 18.97 | 18.50 |
      | 512 | 8192 | 264.42 | 263.49 |
- [x] **1e. Empty page table or cache.** A nonempty index list with
      `k_cache.shape[0] == 0` or `page_table.shape[1] == 0` returns
      zeros before launch, next to the empty-query return. No table
      scan and no tile-loop branch.
      `test_k2_empty_cache_or_table_returns_zeros` saw a launch on the
      unfixed tree for both geometries and now gets zeros without one.
      The family A decode oracle is the smoke call; the kernel is
      unchanged, so the bar shapes were not re-timed.

### 2. K1 page faults

The K1 tile-extent audit. The prefill fault was reproduced. The decode
fault, the K1 4 GiB cap, and the i32 score index were not run; verify
them, and fix the ones that are real. Do not change score math.

- [x] **2a. Prefill page-table over-read.** The prefill K gather
      bounds `col_live` by `context_lens[0] / R` and requires
      `phys_live = (phys >= 0) & (phys < n_cache_blocks)` before the
      load, using a safe page id. `n_cache_blocks` is passed only on
      the prefill launch. Score math, the selector, `n_columns`, and
      the decode scorer are unchanged. The K descriptor is still the
      default `max_size=True`; the 4 GiB cap is 2c.
      `test_k1_prefill_padded_page_table`: one request, M=32, context
      4096, 64 real pages, four padded entries. On the unfixed tree
      pad `-1` aborted the process at the result read. Pad 0, pad
      `-1`, and page id 100000 match the oracle after the fix.
      `test_k1_family_a_set_equality_prefill` stays green.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate. Long-row prefill, one request, 2048
      columns, so the prefill scorer ran:

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 512 | 8192 | 30.20 | 30.46 |
- [x] **2b. Decode page ids.** The one-row scorer now requires
      `phys_live = (phys >= 0) & (phys < n_cache_blocks)` and loads K
      at the safe page id. A dead column still reads entry 0, but a
      `-1` there is not a cache index, and a `-1` inside the visible
      range drops that column. `n_cache_blocks` is a decode-launch
      argument. Score math, the selector, and `n_columns` are unchanged.
      `test_k1_decode_rejects_invalid_page_ids` uses M=4 and a table
      wider than 512 columns, so the one-row scorer runs. On the
      unfixed tree the no-page request (entry 0 is `-1`) aborted the
      process when the selector launched. After the fix that request
      selects nothing, and a `-1` on a visible page matches the oracle
      with those blocks masked. `test_k1_family_a_set_equality_two_tiles`
      stays green.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate:

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 1 | 32768 | 15.08 | 15.00 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 20.45 | 20.37 |
- [x] **2c. K1 4 GiB cache.** 1a's helper is closed over inside the
      K2 kernel, so both K1 scorers use the same scheme rather than a
      shared function: a cache that fits in 4 GiB keeps one whole-cache
      descriptor, and a larger cache is a separate compile that rebases
      each gathered row in 64-bit and then covers only that row.
      `test_k1_page_past_4gib`: physical page 1048576 starts at 4 GiB
      and holds ones; every other logical page is zeros. On the unfixed
      tree M=4 selected page 0's blocks. After the fix M=4 (one-row
      scorer) and M=32 (prefill scorer) match the oracle. The fast-path
      two-tile and prefill set-equality tests stay green.

      GPU 6, cold `--rotate 0`, `CACHE=0`, control taken immediately
      before the candidate. These shapes fit in 4 GiB, so they take the
      whole-cache compile:

      | M | L | before µs | after µs |
      |--:|--:|----------:|---------:|
      | 1 | 32768 | 14.58 | 15.15 |
      | 8 | 32768 | 19.25 | 20.62 |
      | 512 | 8192 | 31.21 | 29.94 |
- [x] **2d. i32 score-store index.** The store is `scores[row, out_col]`.
      The row stride of that contiguous fp32 matrix is a dynamic i64
      (tensor strides are i64 unless a kernel asks for 32-bit strides;
      these scorers do not). The i32 row is widened before the
      multiply, so `M * n_columns >= 2^31` does not wrap the address.
      Serving shapes do not reach that product anyway. The harness
      prefill is at most `M=8192`, and the long context is 128k tokens,
      which is 32768 indexer blocks. `8192 * 32768 = 2^28`. The
      review's `16384 × 131072` is twice that `M` and four times that
      column count. No store change, so the bar shapes were not re-timed.

### 3. K1 gfx942 H=8 LDS and arch allowlist

Review must-fix 4 and should-fix 7. Source analysis; GPU 6 is gfx950
and does not prove the LDS budget.

- [x] **3a. H=8 prefill LDS.** The 16-row tile is Q `16·H·128` bf16
      + K `32·128` bf16 + 16 int32s + C `H·2·2·64·4` fp32. At `H=8`
      that is 73,792 bytes, over gfx942's 65,536. `H=4` is 41,024 and
      fits. The one-row tile does not grow with `H` (Q is 16-wide, C
      is reused per head), so gfx942 `H=8` now takes that scorer.
      gfx950 `H=8` still takes the 16-row builder, and that builder's
      source is unchanged (`block_m = 16`, `block_n = 32`), so the
      gfx950 prefill bar was not re-timed.
      `test_k1_gfx942_h8_skips_prefill_tile` failed on the old dispatch
      with `gfx942 H=8 still dispatches the 16-row tile` and passes
      after. `test_k1_family_a_set_equality_prefill` still passes on
      this gfx950 box.
- [x] **3b. Runtime arch allowlist.** Both wrappers treated every
      device whose name does not start with `gfx950` as the gfx942
      path. `qsa_device_arch` keeps the ISA token before the first
      colon and accepts only `gfx942` and `gfx950`. `qsa_k1_block_ids`,
      `qsa_k1_score_and_select`, and `qsa_k2` call it with
      `q.device`'s `gcnArchName` before a kernel launch, and the
      long-row scorer does so again before `topk_select`. K32 stays
      `arch == "gfx950"`. `topk_select` still gates on `get_gfx()`.
      `test_qsa_arch_allowlist` failed on the unfixed tree with
      `No module named 'aiter.ops.flydsl.kernels.qsa.arch'` and passes
      after. Suffixes such as `gfx942:sramecc+:xnack-` still resolve,
      and `gfx1100`, `gfx1250`, `gfx90a`, `gfx9420`, and `GFX950` raise.
      The kernel bodies are unchanged, so the bar shapes were not
      re-timed. This container's GPU 6 is MI300X gfx942; the live name
      resolves to gfx942, which is the same tile the old
      `startswith("gfx950")` test selected. Pytest gate, `CACHE=0`:
      34 passed.

### 4. Score-matrix scope, benches, and K1 assertions

Review should-fix 6, 8, and 9, the "consider" assertion note, and the
still-open ticket-doc half of "Earlier findings." No kernel change.

- [x] **4a. Resolve the score-matrix conflict in the ticket.** Phase 2
      of `SILOTIGER-1047.md` said "No full score matrix." It now matches
      the parent lock: fused emit writes ids with no score matrix when
      `visible <= 512`, and longer rows materialize an `[M, n_blocks]`
      fp32 buffer. The long-row allocation in `k1.py` is unchanged.
- [ ] **4b. K1 bench timings cover the same work.** `bench_qsa_family_a_k1`
      times `qsa_k1_block_ids` and stops at block ids. The vLLM and
      #4882 columns time `qsa_select_paged_tokens` /
      `qsa_4882_select_paged_tokens`, which include expand. Time expand
      on the FlyDSL column too, or stop the competitor columns before
      expand. Say which in the bench docstring. The layer bench is
      already a matched chain; leave it.
- [ ] **4c. Sweep mismatches fail, and requested M is not dropped.**
      Kernel benches return `err` and `__main__` only logs the table.
      FlyDSL K1/K2 loops keep `M <= 8` and `M == 512`, so a requested
      `M` of 64, 2048, or 8192 never appears. Fail the sweep on a
      nonzero K1 set mismatch and on a K2 `err` above the unit-test
      tolerance. Run requested `M` values, or log an explicit skip
      that names the kernel's supported band. Do not silently `continue`.
- [ ] **4d. Stronger K1 assertions.** `_set_mismatch_ratio` compares
      sets and ignores duplicates and order. On the existing K1 unit
      cases, also require no duplicate ids and a compact valid prefix
      followed by `-1`. Set equality stays.

### 5. Behavior-preserving kernel cleanup

Review should-fix 10, plus the audit notes that are dead code rather
than faults. Read `flydsl-kernel-code-cleanup` before editing. No
numeric change, no schedule change, no bar re-time beyond the pytest
gate unless a diff is not comment-only — if the diff is not
comment-only, re-time the touched kernel and revert on a loss.

- [ ] **5a. K2 header.** The module docstring says gfx950 always stores
      K and V separately. Decode still overlays one tile;
      `split_kv_lds` is prefill-only. Make the header match.
- [ ] **5b. Dead K2 values.** `k2.py` ~339 builds a tiled copy and
      discards it. ~370 discards `make_tiled_copy_B(...).get_slice(lane)`.
      Remove them if they have no side effect. Leave `qk_a_copy` and
      `kv_store`; those are used.
- [ ] **5c. Emit's unused arguments.** The emit kernel takes `q`,
      `k_cache`, `page_table`, and `score_scale` and does not read
      them (`k1.py` ~69). Drop them from the kernel if the launch ABI
      can change without a second compiled entry, or stop threading
      them through. Do not change the ids the emit writes.

### 6. QSA AOT registration

"Earlier findings": there is no QSA `OpKind` or collector registration.
`aiter/aot/flydsl/common.py` `OpKind` is still MoE, GEMM, conv, GDN,
and FMHA. The collector does not treat a `[None]` job list as "no
configs"; use `default_jobs()`, the same pattern as `mega_moe.py`.

- [ ] **6a.** Add a QSA `OpKind` and a collector that returns
      `default_jobs()` for the shapes this campaign already compiles
      (family A K1 emit + long-row scorer, family A K2 bar launch).
      Do not register every bench shape. The JIT wrappers stay the
      runtime path; AOT must not add a lookup to `qsa_k1_block_ids`
      or `qsa_k2`.
- [ ] **6b.** A collector unit check: an empty config list is an empty
      job list, not a `[None]` sentinel. No GPU required.

### 7. Optional split workspace

"Consider" in the review. Not required to close the review.

`qsa_k2` allocates fp32 partials on every split launch (`k2.py`
~1249). At family A, `M=128` and 8 splits, that is about 24 MiB. It
was not measured.

- [ ] **7a.** Profile the bar shapes. If the allocation is not visible
      against the kernel, check this box with the profile note and
      do not change the API.
- [ ] **7b.** If it is visible, accept a caller-owned workspace and
      keep the current allocation as the default when the caller
      passes none. Re-time the bar shapes. The default path must not
      get a second buffer.
