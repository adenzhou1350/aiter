"""Tuning thresholds that do not depend on the kernel family.

A value belongs here when its justification never mentions a family: how long
to measure, when a faster candidate is worth publishing over the one already
serving. What a family tunes (key fields, candidates, legality, its error
metric) stays in that family's tuner or policy module, and a family that needs
a different threshold overrides it there with ``dataclasses.replace`` rather
than restating the default.

Standard library only, so the runtime and the tests can import it without
pulling in torch or a device.

``PromotionPolicy.min_improvement_pct`` is the one bar for replacing what a
shape runs today. ``--compare --update_improved`` applies it after tuning, by
timing each shape through the operator serving calls with the old and the new
tuned CSV. A tuner that times the incumbent next to the challengers applies it
during the search, through ``gate_against_incumbent``.
