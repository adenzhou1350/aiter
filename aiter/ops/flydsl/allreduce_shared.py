    Arch is not enough to make this call: an MI350X (xGMI) and an MI350P
    (PCIe-only) both report ``gfx950``, and the right inbox memory type is
    opposite on the two. KFD exposes the real link type per peer pair, so read
    that instead of guessing from the SKU.

    Both ``io_links`` and ``p2p_links`` have to be scanned. KFD only populates
    ``p2p_links`` for peers reachable indirectly (through a host bridge), so on
    a directly-connected mesh it holds nothing but the PCIe links to the CPU
    nodes and the xGMI peers appear solely under ``io_links``. Reading
    ``p2p_links`` alone reports "PCIe" on an 8-GPU all-xGMI MI350X, which flips
    ``inbox_memory="auto"`` to the fine-grained heap and silently costs the
    uncached fanout the kernel was designed around.

    Returns True when the topology cannot be read, which keeps the historical
    uncached allocation on any host we cannot classify -- the failure mode of
    guessing "PCIe" on an xGMI box is a silent perf regression on hardware
    where the current design is already optimal.

    The answer is per host, not per process group: one xGMI link anywhere
    classifies every group on the node as xGMI. That assumes a node is uniformly
    xGMI or uniformly PCIe, which holds for the single-node systems this targets.
    On a mixed host, a group of PCIe-only peers would get the xGMI policy and an
    uncached inbox; fixing that means classifying only the links between the
    group's own devices.
