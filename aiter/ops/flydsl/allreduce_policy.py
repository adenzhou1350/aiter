"""Which FlyDSL all-reduce schedule to run, as a function of payload size.

There are three schedules and the fastest one is a function of how many bytes
are being reduced:

* **one-shot** (``OneShotAllReduce``) -- one round, no grid-wide barrier, wire
  volume ``(N-1)*S``. Exact: fp32 accumulate, one bf16 rounding.
* **mesh** (``FlyQuickAllReduce(algorithm="mesh")``) -- two-shot, fanout to all
  ``N-1`` peers twice, wire volume ``2(N-1)/N*S``, INT4 on the wire.
* **ring** (``FlyQuickAllReduce(algorithm="ring")``) -- two-shot, ``2(N-1)``
  hops, same wire volume as the mesh, traded for per-destination locality.

They do not share a dispatcher. Each lives in the aiter slot whose accuracy
contract it already matches, and this module hands each slot its own view of
one shared table row:

* ``resolve_oneshot`` -> ``CustomAllreduce``, which is exact.
* ``resolve_quant``   -> ``QuickAllReduce``, which is allowed to quantize.
