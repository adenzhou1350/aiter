"""Host launch for gfx942/gfx950 TP∈{2,4,8} INT4/INT6 all-reduce.

Public type ``FlyQuickAllReduce``, with two interchangeable schedules selected
by ``algorithm``. Both are two-shot -- reduce-scatter then all-gather -- so
they are named for the topology of each lap instead:

* ``"mesh"`` the default: fanout to all N-1 peers, twice.
* ``"ring"`` 2(N-1) single-destination hops.

Super-tile ST∈{1,8} on the mesh, ST∈{1,8,16,32} on the ring. INT4 nibble,
INT5 nibble+1-bit plane, or INT6 bit-plane pair, all with group-16 E4M3
scales. INT5 is mesh-only. Payload HBM is bf16.

Two more tuning knobs ride every ladder rung: ``block`` (threads per workgroup,
which sets the tile) and, on the mesh only, ``skip_self`` (no round trip through
this rank's own inbox). Ladders are keyed on ``(link, world_size)``.

    """IPC inbox + flag buffer and launch wrapper for ``quick_allreduce_mesh``.

    Requires a non-NCCL, single-node process group for IPC metadata exchange.

    ``algorithm`` selects the schedule. Both are two-shot -- reduce-scatter
    then all-gather -- so they are named for the topology of each lap:

    * ``"mesh"`` (default) -- each rank pushes to every one of the ``N-1``
      peers, twice. Two hops. Optimal on a meshed xGMI node.
    * ``"ring"`` -- ``2(N-1)`` hops, each a single contiguous run into exactly
      one peer's inbox. Same wire volume (``2(N-1)/N`` of the payload), traded
      for per-destination locality. Structurally worse at decode sizes and on
      xGMI -- opt in deliberately.

    ``rs_codec`` and ``ag_codec`` are the wire formats of the ring's two laps.
    The reduce-scatter lap is the only place the ring loses accuracy the mesh
    does not -- it requantizes ``N-1`` times where the mesh requantizes once --
    so it defaults to ``"int6"`` at TP8, where INT4 would cost too much
    accuracy. The all-gather lap forwards bytes verbatim and contributes a
    single quantization, so it defaults to ``"int4"`` everywhere and widens
    only by request.

    Leave both ``None`` to get those defaults.

    ``inbox_memory`` selects how the IPC inbox is allocated:

    * ``"auto"`` (default) -- ``uncached`` on hosts with xGMI peer links,
      ``finegrained`` on PCIe-attached hosts, decided from the KFD topology.
      TP2 is ``uncached`` on PCIe too: one remote peer cannot collapse.
    * ``"uncached"`` -- correct everywhere, but peer writes collapse on PCIe.
    * ``"finegrained"`` -- device-coherent, full PCIe rate. Cacheable, so each
      publish writes the payload back from the writer's L2 with a release fence
      before the flag goes out write-through (``sc0 sc1``).

    ``min_bytes`` is the payload below which ``allreduce`` refuses to run,
    defaulting to ``MIN_PAYLOAD_BYTES``. ``compile_and_launch`` is deliberately
    not gated: its warmup tensor is allowed to be small.

    ``link`` selects the tuning ladder and is detected from the KFD topology
    when not given. ``block`` and ``skip_self`` override those knobs on every
    rung, ``None`` leaving each rung's own value; ``skip_self`` is mesh-only.
    Under ``skip_self`` the mesh specialises its binary to this rank, so the
    JIT symbol carries an ``_r<n>_`` field.
