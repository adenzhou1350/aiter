"""gfx942/gfx950 TP∈{2,4,8} exact one-shot (1-stage) all-reduce.

Decode-regime kernel: bf16 in, fp32 accumulate, bf16 out, no codec. One
communication round and no grid-wide barrier -- each rank pushes its whole
tile into every peer's inbox, publishes a colour flag, waits for the N flags,
then reduces N copies out of its own inbox.

This kernel trades wire volume for round trips:
(N-1)*S pushed rather than (N-1)*S read, but ~2 serialized fabric traversals
rather than ~6.

No LDS is needed: thread ``t``'s 16 B lands at the same offset in every destination,
so it can be pushed straight from registers.
