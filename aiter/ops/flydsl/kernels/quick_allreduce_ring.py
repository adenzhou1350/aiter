"""gfx942/gfx950 TP∈{2,4,8} INT4/INT6 **ring** all-reduce.

Topology of the lap: the ranks form a cycle and every step is a single
contiguous run into exactly one peer's inbox:

* ``2(N-1)`` hops and ``2(N-1)`` handshakes.
* ``2(N-1)/N`` of the payload on the wire. The ring is bandwidth
  optimal (Patarasuk & Yuan, JPDC 69(2), 2009).
* One destination per store. On a PCIe host, a GPU has a single shared x16 uplink,
  and a ring step writes ``rank_atoms * rank_tile B`` to one peer, in address
  order, with no destination switch.

The ring pays for that schedule is accuracy: its reduce-scatter lap
requantizes the *running partial sum* ``N-1`` times where the mesh requantizes
once, and the partial's extremum grows with the number of contributions folded
into it. Hence the two codec knobs. Widening the reduce-scatter lap to INT6 improves
accuracy with the cost of using slightly more bandwidth. The all-gather lap forwards
the bytes it received untouched, so it contributes exactly one quantization and stays
INT4 unless the caller pins it via the ``ag_codec`` argument.

A third wire format, ``"fp16"``, is a lossless passthrough. Mainly for testing.
